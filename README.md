Stock and Production Serial Number
==================================

**This project has been moved to https://launchpad.net/~eoc**

Adds unique serial numbers to the production lots
and stock moves.

This software was original writed by **Cubic ERP** for OpenERP 6.0, and
was modified by **Enterprise Objects Consulting** to be compatible
with **OpenERP 6.1**.

Also was modified to improve the filter views, and to be possible
share serial numbers between sub products (util in manufacturing
process and group products).
